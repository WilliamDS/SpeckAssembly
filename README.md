This is a simple program I wrote to implement the Speck cipher.  I based it off of the NSA's research paper that Bruce Schneier posted on his blog.  I am not so sure I would trust it to be very secure (it might be but it has only been known to the public since 2013).  In any case it is an interesting programming exercise.  The Speck.dll was the final product after compilation.
